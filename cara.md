# Ignoring Files 

It is important to understand how to ignore files in a directory that we do not want to push to GitHib.

 You can ignore:
 - Individual Files
 - Entire Directories 
 - Files inside a directory/anywhere in the repository 
 - All files with the same file extension 

## Ignoring a single file
When pushing files to GitHub, we have the opetion to ignore a single file.
