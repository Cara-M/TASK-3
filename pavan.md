# Three Main Trees

## There are three main trees in a SCM:

### Working Directory:
. The area in which you are working on your CLI
. Shown by using the command pwd

### Staging Area:
. A rough draft space, where you can add files that you want to save in your next commit

### Repository:
. This is where the SCM stores code
. Can be diferent types of repositories; local, remote, centralised
. Local repository is your own git repository from your computer
. Centralised repositories keep versions consistent
. Repository hosting system is a web-based version of a repository
