<h6>Licensing<h6>
Any work that is produced in the Uk, the owner has copyright to that file created.
There are two types of licensing: Permissive and Strong Copyleft

The permissive licensing allows the public to use, modify, and share the base repository/code. Also, no conditions for the downstream license.
Common permessive license seen:
- MIT
- Apache 2.0
- ISC
- BSD

Note MIT allows a project to be used as a dependency in another.

The strong copyleft licensing requires the user wanting to use the owner's repository/code must have the same licensing as the owners.
Common strong copyleft license seen:
- GPL v2, v3
- AGPL v3
